Description:

Upon launching the application, users create an initial grocery list by selecting items from a predefined set. 
This list forms the foundation for the assistant to understand user requirements and adapt to real-time changes.
Users can modify the grocery list at any time during their shopping session. They can add new items, adjust quantities, and remove unnecessary entries. 
Additionally, users can override the assistantâ€™s suggestions, maintaining full control over their shopping experience.
